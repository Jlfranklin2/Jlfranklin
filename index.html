                <p>Hello! My name is Jaylan Franklin, I am currently a Student-Athlete with the University of the Wisconsin Badgers
  </p>
                
                <p>I have been pursuing a Retail and Consumer Behavior degree, and a Digital Studies Certificate. While my major has changed and I have explored many different avenues, searching for the right path for me and my future has always been my goal. One thing that has not changed is my passion to grow and learn more about the world we live in. I grew up in a small town right outside of Detroit, it's called Rockwood, Michigan. I have 2 brothers who both played sports as well, this created an enviornment filled with competition, leading to me always chasing my brothers and striving for greatness. Things like playing video games, playing sports, and traveling have been apart of my life since i can remember and this allowed me to grow exponentially over the years.   </p>
